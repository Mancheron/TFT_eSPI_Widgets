Canvas Widget demo {#CanvasWidgetDemo}
==================

[See [TFT_CanvasWidget.ino](./TFT_CanvasWidget_8ino-example.html)]: @example{lineno} TFT_CanvasWidget.ino

[Widget]: @ref TFT_eSPI_Widgets::Widget "Widget"

[Canvas]: @ref TFT_eSPI_Widgets::Canvas "Canvas"

This is a very simple demo to show how [Canvas], and more generally
[widgets][Widget], are displayed.

This illustrates the graphical properties concepts, the principle
of setting or not the focus as well as the use of callback.
